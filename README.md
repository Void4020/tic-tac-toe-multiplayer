# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Overview
This Tic Tac Toe game features a core implementation of the game logic created in **Beginner Student Language with Lambda**, adhering to the restriction of having only one expression per function. The full Racket language was utilized solely for server-related functionalities.

## Includes
- Full HTDF recipes for each function
- 3 Modes to play in (Online, Computer, Local)
- Computer Minimax AI with adjustable difficulty

## Multiplayer Setup
To play multiplayer, ensure that you have set up port forwarding on your router. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Public Access**: If you are hosting the server on your Local IP, it will be publicly accessible through your Public IP. However, **Port Forwarding** is needed to allow this.
   
2. **Port Forwarding**:
   - Forward a port using your router settings using your Local IP and an available port.
   - Once you have port forwarded a port on your router, you will need to enter your Local IP.
   - The Local IP of your machine can be found next to **IPv4** when the command `ipconfig` is run on Command Prompt.

3. **Starting The Server**: 
   - You will be prompted whether you want to have the server accessable through localhost (`127.0.0.1`) or your Public IP.
   - Lastly, you will have to enter the port number of the port that has been forwarded.

4. **Connecting The Client**
   - You will be prompted to enter the server's IP address.
   - If the server is on localhost, just enter localhost or `127.0.0.1`
   - If the server is accessable through a public IP, all you have to do is enter the server's **PUBLIC IP ADDRESS** (not local, that is hidden). It can be found anywhere online, e.g., [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com)) along with the port that you ran the server on.
  
5. **Firewall Settings**
   - You may need to ensure that the firewall on your computer allows incoming connections on the port.
   - Windows: Windows Defender Firewall -> Advanced Settings -> Inbound Rules -> New Rule -> Select Port, choose TCP and specify the port number, Allow Connection, Check Domain + Private + Public.

### Security Caution
Setting up port forwarding and allowing incoming connections on a specific port can create potential security risks.
This is why you should set up **Whitelisting** in your server's firewall settings.
- Windows: Go to the same inbound rule you made -> Properties -> Scope -> Remote IP Addresses
- Any time someone wants to connect, make sure to add their Public IP to Remote IP Addresses

However, this means that if you want to connect to the server with a device already under the same Public IP (LAN), you would have to enable **Nat Loopback / Hairpinning** on your router settings.
Alternatively, if your router doesn't support this or you dont feel like it, on the client side, when it prompts you for the server's IP, just enter the server's **Local IP** since it is on the same LAN.

## Game Rules
The rules of Tic Tac Toe are as follows:
- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns placing their mark (X or O) in an empty cell.
- The first player to get three of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all cells are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
